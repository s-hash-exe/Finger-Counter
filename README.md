# Finger-Counter

A real-time finger counter system built using OpenCV and MediaPipe.

## Working
OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. 
Mediapipe is a cross-platform library developed by Google that provides amazing ready-to-use ML solutions for computer vision tasks. This project uses Mediapipe Hands.
MediaPipe Hands is a high-fidelity hand and finger tracking solution. It employs machine learning (ML) to infer 21 3D landmarks of a hand from just a single frame.
Using few of these 21 different landmarks and python scripting finger counting is made possible.
